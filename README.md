# imageprocessor
program that processes images in various ways

## How this works
This program takes in a bmp file and translates that to a vector of vectors of structures called a Pixel. There is user interface that asks the user which process they want to carry out and allows them to exit the interface whenever they wish. The input files should be in the same dirctory as the main.cpp file itself.
